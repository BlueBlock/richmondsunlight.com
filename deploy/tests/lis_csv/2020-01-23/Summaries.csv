a covered person receives covered emergency services from an out-of-network

out-of-network provider any amount other than the applicable cost-sharing
requirement. The measure deletes a provision that allows an out-of-network
provider to charge an individual for the balance of the provider's billed
amount after applying the amount the health carrier is required to pay for such
services. The measure also establishes a fourth standard for calculating the
health carrier's required payment to the out-of-network provider of the
emergency services, which standard is (i) the regional average for commercial
payments for such service if the provider is a health care professional or (ii)
the fair market value for such services if the provider is a facility. This
fourth standard is the amount the health carrier is obligated to pay to the
out-of-network provider if the amount is greater than any of the other three
standards, which are (a) the amount negotiated with in-network providers for
the emergency service or, if more than one amount is negotiated, the median of
these amounts; (b) the amount for the emergency service calculated using the
same method the health carrier generally uses to determine payments for
out-of-network services, such as the usual, customary, and reasonable amount;
or (c) the amount that would be paid under Medicare for the emergency service.
The measure requires the health carrier to pay the required amount, less
applicable cost-sharing requirements, directly to the out-of-network health
care provider of the emergency services. If such provider determines that the
amount to be paid by the health carrier does not comply with the applicable
requirements, the measure requires the provider and the health carrier to make
a good faith effort to reach a resolution on the appropriate amount of the
reimbursement and, if a resolution is not reached, authorizes either party to
request the State Corporation Commission to review the disputed reimbursement
amount and determine if the amount complies with applicable requirements. The
measure also provides that final diagnosis rendered to a covered person who
receives emergency services for a medical condition shall not be considered in
the health carrier's determination of whether the medical condition was an
emergency medical condition. The measure establishes the procedure by which the
regional average for commercial payments for emergency services will be

a covered person receives covered emergency services from an out-of-network

measure deletes a provision that allows an out-of-network provider to charge an
individual for the balance of the provider's billed amount after applying the
amount the health carrier is required to pay for such services. The measure
also establishes a fourth standard for calculating the health carrier's
required payment to the out-of-network provider of the emergency services,
which standard is (i) the regional average for commercial payments for such
service if the provider is a health care professional or (ii) the fair market
value for such services if the provider is a facility. This fourth standard is
the amount the health carrier is obligated to pay to the out-of-network
provider if the amount is greater than any of the other three standards, which
are (a) the amount negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency
service or, if more than one amount is negotiated, the median of these amounts;
(b) the amount for the emergency service calculated using the same method the
health carrier generally uses to determine payments for out-of-network
services, such as the usual, customary, and reasonable amount; or (c) the
amount that would be paid under Medicare for the emergency service. The measure
requires the health carrier to pay the required amount, less applicable
cost-sharing requirements, directly to the out-of-network health care provider
of the emergency services. If such provider determines that the amount to be
paid by the health carrier does not comply with the applicable requirements,
the measure requires the provider and the health carrier to make a good faith
effort to reach a resolution on the appropriate amount of the reimbursement
and, if a resolution is not reached, authorizes either party to request the
State Corporation Commission to review the disputed reimbursement amount and
determine if the amount complies with applicable requirements. The measure also
provides that final diagnosis rendered to a covered person who receives
emergency services for a medical condition shall not be considered in the
health carrier's determination of whether the medical condition was an
emergency medical condition. The measure establishes the procedure by which the
regional average for commercial payments for emergency services will be

Replaces the Virginia Electric Utility Regulation Act with a system under which
retail customers will be able to purchase electricity from the retail electric provider
of their choice. The measure requires each incumbent investor-owned utility,
electric cooperative, and municipal electric authority by January 10, 2021, to
file with the State Corporation Commission a plan by which it will separate its
customer energy services business activities that are otherwise also already
widely available in the competitive market from its regulated utility
activities by September 1, 2021, and to separate its business activities into
an electric distribution utility, an electric transmission utility, a power
generation company, and a retail electric provider, or into a single electric
transmission and distribution utility, by January 1, 2022. Such separation may
be accomplished by creating separate investor-owned companies, cooperatives, or
municipal electric authorities or through the sale of assets to a third party.
The measure provides consumer safeguards, including requirements that a retail
customer have the right to choose a retail electric provider and to have access
to providers of energy efficiency services, to on-site distributed generation,
and to providers of energy generated by renewable energy resources. When
customer choice commences, a retail electric provider that is serving a retail
customer on December 31, 2021, may continue to serve that customer until the
customer chooses service from a different retail electric provider. If the
Commission determines that a region served by an incumbent electric utility is
unable to offer fair competition and reliable service to all retail customer
classes on January 1, 2022, the measure requires the Commission to delay
customer choice for the region. The Commission may use pilot projects to
evaluate the ability of each region served by an incumbent electric utility to
implement customer choice. After January 1, 2022, an incumbent electric utility
may not sell electricity or otherwise participate in the market for electricity
except for the purpose of buying electricity to serve its own needs or while
competition for the region served by the utility is delayed. The measure
requires the Commission to designate, through a bid process or other method,
retail electric providers to serve as providers of last resort, which will be
required to offer a customer retail service at a rate approved by the
Commission. Metering services will be provided by an area's incumbent electric
utility or the electric distribution utility separated from the incumbent
electric utility. Each electric distribution utility is required to bill a
customer's retail electric provider for non-bypassable delivery charges equal
to the sum of electric utility charges by customer class based on a forecasted
2022 test year and the generic customer classes and generic rate design
established by the Commission and a system benefit fund fee. The system benefit
fund fee will be allocated to retail electric customers on the basis of the
amount of kilowatt hours used and will be set by the Commission in an amount to
cover the costs of customer education programs, a percentage of income payment
plan, weatherization programs, and energy efficiency programs. The measure
requires electric distribution utilities to deploy advanced metering and meter
information networks for all of their residential customers and nonresidential
customers within three years after the start date of customer choice, the costs
of which shall be recovered by a non-bypassable surcharge. The measure
authorizes the Commission to mitigate market power abuses associated with the
transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity. The measure requires the
Commission by March 1, 2021, to establish an independent distribution system
operator (IDSO) that will operate and plan the distribution systems of all
electric distribution utilities and perform other duties, including ensuring
open access to the distribution systems for all buyers and sellers of
electricity on nondiscriminatory terms. The IDSO's costs will be recovered
through a reasonable and competitively neutral rate or fee that is within a
range determined by the Commission. Distribution utilities are required to
transfer the management and control of their distribution system assets to the
IDSO and to observe the IDSO's policies, rules, guidelines, and procedures. By
January 1, 2021, each electric utility is required to file proposed tariffs for
its open-access distribution service, and the Commission is required to set
tariffs for electric utility services and the system benefit fund fee for each
utility by January 1, 2022. The rates are required to afford the utility a
reasonable opportunity to recover its reasonable costs and a reasonable rate of
return, fairly allocate the utility's costs among customers, and provide an
appropriate price signal to customers with respect to renewable energy. The
measure requires incumbent retail electric providers to make available from
January 1, 2022, until January 1, 2027, to residential and small commercial
retail electric customers in its former service area utility &quot;price to
beat rates&quot; that are six percent less than the incumbent electric
utility's corresponding average rates that were in effect on January 1, 2019,
adjusted to reflect the wholesale power cost basis. Incumbent retail electric
providers are prohibited from charging these customers rates that are different
from the price to beat until the earlier of 36 months after the date customer
choice is introduced or the date that at least 40 percent of the electric power
consumed in the utility's service area before customer choice is committed to
be served by independent retail electric providers. The measure requires that
retail electric providers be certified by the Commission and that aggregators
register with the Commission. The measure establishes a Percentage of Income
Payment Plan (PIPP) providing financial assistance for residential customers
whose household income is at or below 150 percent of the federal nonfarm
poverty level. Under the PIPP, the level of payment responsibility to be borne
by an eligible customer is based on a percentage of the customer's income.
Participants in the PIPP will receive a monthly credit for the amount by which
the participant's actual monthly bill for electric service or the statewide
average monthly bill amount for that month, whichever is less, exceeds 10
percent of the participant's monthly household income if the participant's
residence's primary source of space heating is electricity or six percent of
the participant's monthly household income if the participant's residence's
primary source of space heating is natural gas or propane. The Commission is
also required to establish and implement a home weatherization program. The
measure requires the IDSO to identify the achievable cost-effective energy
efficiency potential for each electric distribution utility service area in the
Commonwealth and, if it determines that an electric distribution utility
service area has achievable cost-effective energy efficiency potential, to
issue a solicitation for bids from persons to develop and implement energy
efficiency programs that achieve this potential. The measure authorizes any
distributed electricity generation owner to connect distributed electricity
generation to an electric distribution utility system and authorizes a retail
electric provider to contract with a distributed electricity generation owner
to provide that surplus electricity produced by distributed electricity
generation is made available for sale to the retail electric provider and that
the net value of that surplus electricity valued at the energy price at the location
of the distributed electricity generator is credited to the distributed
electricity generation owner. The measure provides that electric authorities
and municipalities that provide electric transmission or distribution service
are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. The measure recasts the
Commission on Electric Utility Regulation as the Commission on Retail Electric
Choice and extends its sunset until July 1, 2022. The measure limits the powers
of electric cooperatives and eliminates their authority to operate prepaid
metering systems. The measure eliminates the requirement that the Commission
find that a utility's proposed construction of a new generation facility of 100
megawatts or more is necessary to enable the utility to furnish reasonably
adequate service and facilities at reasonable and just rates. The measure also
provides that customers who are participating in net energy metering programs
and third party power purchase programs may continue to do so under certain
circumstances.</p>

the Virginia Highway Corporation Act of 1988. The measure adds requirements
that toll rates not materially discourage the public's use of the toll road,
that the cost of operating the toll road be reasonably apportioned across all
toll road users based on the relative distance each class of user travels on
the toll road such that the toll rates are established in a reasonable and
nondiscriminatory manner in relation to the benefit obtained, and that toll
rates shall provide the operator with no more than a reasonable return. In
addition, the measure (i) requires the SCC, by October 1, 2020, to initiate an
investigation into the tolls charged by all operators subject to the Act and to
issue a ruling by April 1, 2021, on its investigation as to whether the current
tolls charged by the operator comply with such new requirements; (ii) prohibits
the SCC from using during any future complaint proceeding the fact that any
incremental return resulting from increased traffic related to a relative
change in potential toll users that is greater than zero on a cumulative basis
as the sole basis for finding that the operator's return exceeds a reasonable
level as specified in such new requirements; (iii) requires the SCC, in its
initial investigation, to develop a baseline from which it can measure the
relative change in potential toll users and directs how the incremental return
shall be computed; (iv) prohibits an operator from seeking a toll increase that
attempts to raise its return above the reasonable level; (v) requires the full
disclosure, in public financial reports to the SCC, of the details of any
related party transactions; and (vi) establishes a presumption that any related
party transactions shall be presumed to be imprudent and excluded from costs
used for any purpose, including but not limited to costs of lobbyists,
excessive compensation, and entertainment expenses, unless the operator
provides information showing that at least three separate competitive bids
demonstrate that the operator could not have achieved better contract terms
from a third party.</p>

Decriminalizes simple marijuana possession and provides a civil penalty of no

marijuana in a public place at the time of the violation, no more than $250.
Current law imposes a maximum fine of $500 and a maximum 30-day jail sentence
for a first offense, and subsequent offenses are a Class 1 misdemeanor. The
bill provides that any person who knowingly or intentionally smokes, consumes,
or otherwise ingests marijuana while driving or operating a motor vehicle,

driver's license suspension provisions apply only to criminal violations or to
civil violations by a juvenile. A civil violation will be treated as a
conviction for prohibitions on the purchase or transport of a handgun and
disqualification for a concealed handgun permit. The bill also (i) makes
records relating to the arrest, criminal charge, or conviction of possession of
marijuana not open to public inspection and disclosure, except in certain

Under current law, such person may petition for a writ based on biological

 Reporting Database into which sheriffs, police forces, and State Police officers report certain 
 data pertaining to motor 
 vehicle or investigatory stops. The Department is 
 directed to use the database to collect and analyze motor vehicle and

 force. The data analysis shall be used to determine the existence and prevalence of the 
 practice of bias-based profiling and the prevalence 
 of complaints alleging the use of excessive force. The bill requires that each 
 time a local law-enforcement officer or State Police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle the 
 officer collect the following data: (i) the race, ethnicity, age, and gender of 
 the person stopped; (ii) the reason for the stop;

<p class=sumtext><b>Balance billing; emergency services. </b>Provides 
 that when a covered person receives covered emergency services from an 
 out-of-network health care provider, the covered person is not required to pay 
 the out-of-network provider any amount other than the applicable cost-sharing 
 requirement. The measure deletes a provision that allows an out-of-network 
 provider to charge an individual for the balance of the provider's billed 
 amount after applying the amount the health carrier is required to pay for such 
 services. The measure also establishes a fourth standard for calculating the 
 health carrier's required payment to the out-of-network provider of the 
 emergency services, which standard is (i) the regional average for commercial 
 payments for such service if the provider is a health care professional or (ii) 
 the fair market value for such services if the provider is a facility. This 
 fourth standard is the amount the health carrier is 
 obligated to pay to the out-of-network provider if the 
 amount is greater than any of the other three standards, which are (a) 
 the amount negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency service or, 
 if more than one amount is negotiated, the median of these amounts; (b) the 
 amount for the emergency service calculated using the same method the health 
 carrier generally uses to determine payments for out-of-network services, such 
 as the usual, customary, and reasonable amount; or (c) the amount that would be 
 paid under Medicare for the emergency service. The measure requires the health 
 carrier to pay the required amount, less applicable cost-sharing requirements, 
 directly to the out-of-network health care provider of the emergency services. 
 If such provider determines that the amount to be paid by the health carrier 
 does not comply with the applicable requirements, the measure requires the 
 provider and the health carrier to make a good faith effort to reach a 
 resolution on the appropriate amount of the reimbursement and, if a resolution 
 is not reached, authorizes either party to request 
 the State Corporation Commission to review the disputed reimbursement amount 
 and determine if the amount complies with applicable requirements. The measure 
 also provides that final diagnosis rendered to a covered person who receives 
 emergency services for a medical condition shall not be 
 considered in the health carrier's determination of whether the medical 
 condition was an emergency medical condition. The measure establishes the 
 procedure by which the regional average for commercial payments for emergency 
 services will be calculated by the nonprofit data services organization that 
 compiles the Virginia All-Payer Claims Database. The measure also requires 
 health carriers to makes reports to the Bureau of Insurance and directs the 
 Bureau to provide reports to certain committees of the General Assembly.</p>

 permit from the Department of Taxation and (ii) at a location within 1,000 feet 
 of a youth-oriented facility, defined in the bill. The bill prohibits Internet 
 sales of tobacco products, except to a permit-holding retailer, and prohibits 
 the sale of tobacco products from vending machines. The bill imposes civil 
 penalties of up to $1,500 for selling tobacco products without a permit and up 
 to $2,000 for selling tobacco products to persons under age 21. Permits would 
 be subject to annual renewal and subject to revocation for violations of 
 federal, state, or local laws related to tobacco products. The bill imposes 
 recordkeeping requirements and makes it a Class 1 misdemeanor to engage in 
 fraud or misrepresentation in connection with an application for a permit.</p>
 
 
<p class=sumtext>The bill updates, for the purpose of the crime of selling or 
 distributing tobacco products to a person younger than 21 years of age, the 
 definition of ""tobacco products"" by including in such definition

<p class=sumtext>The bill provides that the punishment of a retail 
 establishment that sells, gives, or furnishes a tobacco product to a person 
 younger than 21 years of age or to a person who does not demonstrate that such 
 person is at least 21 years of age is a civil penalty of $500 for a first 
 offense, a civil penalty of $1,000 for a second offense, and a civil penalty of 
 $2,500 and a suspension or revocation of such establishment's distributor's 
 license for a third or subsequent offense, regardless of the type of tobacco 
 product. Under current law, such penalties apply only to the sale, 
 distribution, or purchase of a bidi and do not require a suspension or 
 revocation of the establishment's distributor's license, while violations 
 involving all other products are punishable by a civil penalty of $100 for a 
 first offense, a civil penalty of $200 for a second offense, and a civil 
 penalty of $500 for a third or subsequent offense. The bill also removes the 
 exception allowing the sale, giving, or furnishing of any tobacco product, 
 nicotine vapor product, or alternative nicotine vapor product to active-duty 
 military personnel who are 18 years of age or older. Finally, the bill requires 
 agents of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage and Control Authority to conduct a 
 minimum number of two compliance checks each year on any retailer selling 
 tobacco products and to use a person younger than 21 years of age to conduct 
 such checks.</p>

<p class=sumtext><b>Canadian Prescription Drug Importation Program established.</b> Establishes the Canadian Prescription 
 Drug Importation Program, pending federal approval 
 and certification from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
 Services. Under the Program, the Commissioner of Health is required to 
 designate the Department of Health, the Commissioner, or another agency or 
 officer of the Commonwealth; a licensed drug wholesaler; or a nonprofit, 
 nonstock corporation established by the Department as a public instrumentality 
 exercising public and essential governmental functions to (i) import 
 prescription drugs from Canadian suppliers and (ii) distribute the imported 
 prescription drugs to pharmacies or pharmacists in the Commonwealth that 
 contract with the designated entity to make the imported prescription drugs 
 available to residents of the Commonwealth at the cost prescribed in the 
 contract. The measure provides that only 
 prescription drugs that have the highest potential for cost savings to the 
 Commonwealth shall be identified for importation. 
 The Program will authorize the designated entity to purchase prescription drugs 
 from a Canadian supplier and distribute the prescription drugs to pharmacists 
 and pharmacies that are in-network under a health plan provided by a health 
 carrier, state employee health plan or local choice plan, and the Medicaid 
 program. Contracts between the pharmacist or pharmacy and the designated entity 
 will set the price at which the prescription drugs are to be provided to 
 covered individuals. The measure requires the Commissioner, by December 1, 
 2021, to review the proposed Program and, if the proposed Program is approved, 
 to submit the proposed Program for federal review. The Department is also required 
 to prepare an implementation plan, which is to be put into effect six months 
 after the last to occur of (a) the enactment of any legislation required for 
 the establishment of the charge or assessment to finance the Program and (b) 
 receipt of notice that the proposed Program has been

 the annual energy efficiency standard, to allow for the additional recovery of 
 a margin on its program's operating expenses through a rate adjustment clause

 of savings, with a cap on total performance incentive awards in any year of 10 
 percent of the utility's total energy efficiency spending in that year. The

 efficiency programs to include the participation of certain Commission personnel who participate in approval and oversight of utility 
 efficiency programs; (iii) directs the Commission to increase the utility's 
 rates to recover for revenue reductions related to energy efficiency programs 
 if the revenue reductions have caused the utility, during the test period or 
 periods under review, to earn more than 50 basis points below a fair combined 
 rate of return on its generation and distribution services or, for any test

 requirement. The measure deletes a provision that allows an out-of-network 
 provider to charge an individual for the balance of the provider's billed 
 amount after applying the amount the health carrier is required to pay for such

 emergency services, which standard is (i) the regional average for commercial 
 payments for such service if the provider is a health care professional or (ii) 
 the fair market value for such services if the provider is a facility. This 
 fourth standard is the amount the health carrier is 
 obligated to pay to the out-of-network provider if the 
 amount is greater than any of the other three standards, which are (a) 
 the amount negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency service or, 
 if more than one amount is negotiated, the median of these amounts; (b) the 
 amount for the emergency service calculated using the same method the health 
 carrier generally uses to determine payments for out-of-network services, such

 carrier to pay the required amount, less applicable cost-sharing requirements, 
 directly to the out-of-network health care provider of the emergency services. 
 If such provider determines that the amount to be paid by the health carrier 
 does not comply with the applicable requirements, the measure requires the 
 provider and the health carrier to make a good faith effort to reach a 
 resolution on the appropriate amount of the reimbursement and, if a resolution 
 is not reached, authorizes either party to request 
 the State Corporation Commission to review the disputed reimbursement amount 
 and determine if the amount complies with applicable requirements. The measure 
 also provides that final diagnosis rendered to a covered person who receives 
 emergency services for a medical condition shall not be 
 considered in the health carrier's determination of whether the medical 
 condition was an emergency medical condition. The measure establishes the 
 procedure by which the regional average for commercial payments for emergency 
 services will be calculated by the nonprofit data services organization that

<p class=sumtext><b>Electric utility regulation; environmental goals.</b> 
 Replaces the existing voluntary renewable energy portfolio system (RPS) program 
 with a mandatory RPS that applies to electric utilities and licensed 
 competitive suppliers. Under the mandatory RPS, utilities and suppliers are 
 required to produce their electricity from 100 percent renewable sources by 
 2050, with annual steps that direct the electricity be generated in specific percentages 
 in nine tiers or sub-tiers. A utility or supplier that does not meet its 
 targets is required to pay a specific deficiency payment or purchase renewable 
 energy certificates. The proceeds from the deficiency payments are to be 
 deposited into an account administered by the Department of Mines, Minerals and 
 Energy, which is directed to distribute specific percentages of the moneys to 
 low-income, disability, veteran, and age-qualifying energy efficiency programs; 
 additional energy efficiency measures for public facilities; coastal resiliency 
 efforts; and administrative costs. Among other things, the measure also (i) 
 adopts a 2,400 megawatt energy storage deployment target for the Commonwealth 
 and requires the State Corporation Commission (the 
 Commission) to adopt regulations for the implementation of the energy 
 storage deployment target that outline a deployment target of 2,400 megawatts 
 by 2035 with interim targets that include Commission-approved energy storage 
 system resources; (ii) establishes an energy efficiency standard under which 
 each investor-owned incumbent electric utility is required to achieve 
 incremental annual energy efficiency savings that start in 2021 at 0.35 percent 
 of the average annual energy retail sales by that utility in the three preceding 
 calendar years and increase annually until 2027 and thereafter when energy 
 efficiency savings of at least two percent of the average annual energy retail 
 sales by that utility in the three preceding calendar years are required; (iii) 
 exempts large general service customers from energy savings requirements; (iv) 
 revises the incentive for electric utility energy efficiency programs; (v) 
 provides that if the Commission finds in any triennial review that revenue 
 reductions related to energy efficiency measures or programs approved and 
 deployed since the utility's previous triennial review have caused the utility 
 to earn more than 50 basis points below a fair combined rate of return on its 
 generation and distribution services or, for any test period commencing after 
 December 31, 2012, for Dominion Energy Virginia and after December 31, 2013, 
 for American Electric Power, more than 70 basis points below a fair combined 
 rate of return on its generation and distribution services, the Commission 
 shall order increases to the utility's rates for generation and distribution 
 services necessary to recover such revenue reductions; (vi) provides that in 
 the case of a facility utilizing energy derived from offshore wind, the utility 
 shall identify options for utilizing local workers, consult with the 
 Commonwealth's Chief Workforce Development Officer on opportunities to advance 
 the Commonwealth's workforce goals, including furtherance of apprenticeship and 
 other workforce training programs to develop the local workforce, and give 
 priority to the hiring of local workers; (vii) requires each utility to 
 include, and the Commission to consider, in any application to construct a new 
 generating facility the social cost of carbon as a cost adder; (viii) removes 
 provisions that authorize nuclear and offshore wind generating facilities to 
 continue to be eligible for an enhanced rate of return on common equity during 
 the construction phase of the facility and the approved first portion of its 
 service life of between 12 and 25 years in the case of a facility utilizing 
 nuclear power and for a service life of between 5 and 15 years in the case of a 
 facility utilizing energy derived from offshore wind; (ix) removes a provision 
 that declares that planning and development activities for new nuclear 
 generation facilities are in the public interest; (x) removes the limit of 16 megawatts on those offshore wind generation facilities 
 that are declared to be in the public interest; (xi) amends the net energy 
 metering program by increasing the maximum capacity of renewable generation 
 facilities of participating nonresidential eligible customer-generators from 
 one to three megawatts, increases the cap on the capacity of generation from 
 facilities from the customer's expected annual energy consumption to 150 
 percent of such amount, increases each utility's systemwide cap from one percent of its adjusted Virginia 
 peak-load forecast for the previous year to 10 percent of such amount, eliminates the ability of a utility to assess standby 
 charges, and establishes the right to finance 
 electrical generating facilities via leases and power purchase agreements; 
 (xii) removes the ability of utilities in triennial rate reviews to attribute 
 to test periods under review the booked costs of early retirement determinations 
 made by the utility for utility generation facilities fueled by coal, natural 
 gas, or oil; (xiii) directs the State Air Pollution Control Board (the Board) to report to the General Assembly by January 
 1, 2021, on how to achieve 100 percent carbon free 
 electric energy generation by 2050 and whether the General Assembly should 
 permanently repeal the ability to obtain a certificate of public convenience 
 and necessity for electric generating units that emit 
 carbon as a byproduct of combusting fuel to generate electricity; (xiv) bars 
 the Commission from issuing a certificate for public convenience and necessity 
 for any investor-owned utility to own, operate, or construct any electric 
 generating unit that emits carbon as a byproduct of combusting fuel to generate 
 electricity until the General Assembly receives the Board's report; (xv) 
 directs the Board to adopt regulations establishing a carbon dioxide cap and 
 trade program to limit and reduce the total carbon dioxide emissions released 
 by electric generation facilities, which regulations shall comply with the 
 Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative model rule; (xvi) exempts certain pilot 
 programs from the requirements that an energy efficiency program be in the 
 public interest; (xvii) establishes requirements regarding the development by 
 Dominion Energy Virginia of qualified offshore wind projects having an 
 aggregate rated capacity of not less than 5,200 megawatts by January 1, 2034; 
 (xviii) directs the Board to adopt a regulation to reduce, for the period of 2031

 the Commonwealth that serves an electricity generator with a nameplate capacity 
 equal to or greater than 25 megawatts that supplies 10 percent or more of its 
 annual net electrical generation to the electric grid or more than 15 percent 
 of its annual total useful energy to any entity other than the manufacturing 
 facility to which the generating source is interconnected; (xix) establishes a 
 shared solar program that allows customers to purchase electric power through a 
 subscription in a shared solar facility; (xx) repeals 
 the Manufacturing and Commercial Competitiveness Retention Credit that allows 
 certain large nonresidential customers that enter into a three-year minimum 
 exclusive supply agreement to receive a two percent reduction in their base 
 generation charges; (xxi) repeals the authorization for certain third-party power purchase agreements; and (xxii) requires the Department of Mines, Minerals and

<p class=sumtext><b>Electric utility regulation; retail customer choice.</b> 
 Replaces the Virginia Electric Utility Regulation Act with a system under which 
 retail customers will be able to purchase electricity from the retail electric 
 provider of their choice. The measure requires each 
 incumbent investor-owned utility, electric cooperative, and municipal electric 
 authority by January 10, 2021, to file with the State Corporation Commission a 
 plan by which it will separate its customer energy services business activities 
 that are otherwise also already widely available in the competitive market from 
 its regulated utility activities by September 1, 2021, and to separate its 
 business activities into an electric distribution utility, an electric 
 transmission utility, a power generation company, and a retail electric 
 provider, or into a single electric transmission and distribution utility, by 
 January 1, 2022. Such separation may be accomplished by creating separate 
 investor-owned companies, cooperatives, or municipal electric authorities or 
 through the sale of assets to a third party. The measure provides consumer 
 safeguards, including requirements that a retail customer have the right to 
 choose a retail electric provider and to have access to providers of energy 
 efficiency services, to on-site distributed generation, and to providers of 
 energy generated by renewable energy resources. When customer choice commences, 
 a retail electric provider that is serving a retail customer on December 31, 
 2021, may continue to serve that customer until the customer chooses service 
 from a different retail electric provider. If the Commission determines that a 
 region served by an incumbent electric utility is unable to offer fair 
 competition and reliable service to all retail customer classes on January 1, 
 2022, the measure requires the Commission to delay customer choice for the 
 region. The Commission may use pilot projects to evaluate the ability of each 
 region served by an incumbent electric utility to implement customer choice. 
 After January 1, 2022, an incumbent electric utility may not sell electricity 
 or otherwise participate in the market for electricity except for the purpose 
 of buying electricity to serve its own needs or while competition for the 
 region served by the utility is delayed. The measure requires the Commission to 
 designate, through a bid process or other method, retail electric providers to 
 serve as providers of last resort, which will be required to offer a customer 
 retail service at a rate approved by the Commission. Metering services will be 
 provided by an area's incumbent electric utility or the electric distribution 
 utility separated from the incumbent electric utility. Each electric 
 distribution utility is required to bill a customer's retail electric provider 
 for non-bypassable delivery charges equal to the sum of electric utility 
 charges by customer class based on a forecasted 2022 test year and the generic 
 customer classes and generic rate design established by the Commission and a 
 system benefit fund fee. The system benefit fund fee will be allocated to 
 retail electric customers on the basis of the amount 
 of kilowatt hours used and will be set by the 
 Commission in an amount to cover the costs of customer education programs, a 
 percentage of income payment plan, weatherization programs, and energy 
 efficiency programs. The measure requires electric distribution utilities to 
 deploy advanced metering and meter information networks for all of their residential customers and nonresidential customers 
 within three years after the start date of customer choice, 
 the costs of which shall be recovered by a 
 non-bypassable surcharge. The measure authorizes the Commission to mitigate 
 market power abuses associated with the transmission, distribution, and sale of 
 electricity. The measure requires the Commission to 
 establish by March 1, 2021, an independent distribution system operator 
 (IDSO) that will operate and plan the distribution systems of all electric 
 distribution utilities and perform other duties, including ensuring open access 
 to the distribution systems for all buyers and sellers of electricity on nondiscriminatory terms. The IDSO's costs will be 
 recovered through a reasonable and competitively neutral rate or fee that is 
 within a range determined by the Commission. Distribution utilities are 
 required to transfer the management and control of their 
 distribution system assets to the IDSO and to observe the IDSO's policies, 
 rules, guidelines, and procedures. By January 1, 2021, each electric utility is 
 required to file proposed tariffs for its open-access distribution service, and 
 the Commission is required to set tariffs for electric utility services and the 
 system benefit fund fee for each utility by January 1, 2022. The rates are 
 required to afford the utility a reasonable opportunity to recover its 
 reasonable costs and a reasonable rate of return, fairly allocate the utility's 
 costs among customers, and provide an appropriate price signal to customers 
 with respect to renewable energy. The measure requires incumbent retail 
 electric providers to make available from January 1, 2022, until January 1, 
 2027, ""price to beat rates"" to residential and 
 small commercial retail electric customers in its former service area utility 
 that are six percent less than the incumbent electric utility's corresponding 
 average rates that were in effect on January 1, 2019, adjusted to reflect the 
 wholesale power cost basis. Incumbent retail electric providers are prohibited 
 from charging these customers rates that are different from the price to beat 
 until the earlier of 36 months after the date customer choice is introduced or 
 the date that at least 40 percent of the electric power consumed in the 
 utility's service area before customer choice is committed to be served by 
 independent retail electric providers. The measure requires that retail 
 electric providers be certified by the Commission and that aggregators register 
 with the Commission. The measure establishes a Percentage of Income Payment 
 Plan (PIPP) providing financial assistance for residential customers whose 
 household income is at or below 150 percent of the federal nonfarm poverty 
 level. Under the PIPP, the level of payment responsibility to be borne by an 
 eligible customer is based on a percentage of the customer's income. Participants 
 in the PIPP will receive a monthly credit for the amount by which the 
 participant's actual monthly bill for electric service or the statewide average 
 monthly bill amount for that month, whichever is less, exceeds 10 percent of 
 the participant's monthly household income if the participant's residence's 
 primary source of space heating is electricity or six percent of the participant's monthly household income if the 
 participant's residence's primary source of space heating is natural gas or 
 propane. The Commission is also required to 
 establish and implement a home weatherization program. The measure requires the 
 IDSO to identify the achievable cost-effective energy efficiency potential for 
 each electric distribution utility service area in the Commonwealth and, if it 
 determines that an electric distribution utility service area has achievable 
 cost-effective energy efficiency potential, to issue a solicitation for bids 
 from persons to develop and implement energy efficiency programs that achieve 
 this potential. The measure authorizes any distributed electricity generation 
 owner to connect distributed electricity generation to an electric distribution 
 utility system and authorizes a retail electric provider to contract with a 
 distributed electricity generation owner to provide that surplus electricity 
 produced by distributed electricity generation is made available for sale to 
 the retail electric provider and that the net value of that surplus electricity 
 valued at the energy price at the location of the distributed electricity 
 generator is credited to the distributed electricity generation owner. The 
 measure provides that electric authorities and municipalities that provide 
 electric transmission or distribution service are subject to the jurisdiction 
 of the Commission. The measure recasts the Commission on Electric Utility 
 Regulation as the Commission on Energy Reform and extends its sunset until July 
 1, 2022. The measure eliminates the requirement that the Commission find that a 
 utility's proposed construction of a new generation facility of 100 megawatts 
 or more is necessary to enable the utility to furnish reasonably adequate 
 service and facilities at reasonable and just rates. The measure retains net 
 energy metering programs with provisions that revise the compensation structure 
 for the energy produced by distributed customer-generators to implement 
 time-based and location-based market prices. The measure provides that a person 
 that sells electric energy generated from an onsite distributed electric generation 
 facility to a customer pursuant to a third-party power purchase agreement or 
 distributed electric generation lease agreement is not a public service 
 corporation. The measure repeals the provisions establishing requirements for 
 the filing of integrated resources plans by electric utilities. </p>

 Redistricting Commission.</b> Provides for the establishment of the Virginia 
 Citizens Redistricting Commission (the Commission), 
 a 10-member commission responsible for establishing 
 legislative and congressional districts following a decennial census. A 
 selection committee consisting of five retired judges of a circuit court in 
 Virginia, selected by the Speaker of the House of 
 Delegates, the minority leader in the House of Delegates, and the majority and 
 minority leaders in the Senate from a list compiled by the Chief Justice 
 of the Supreme Court of Virginia, is tasked with adopting a process by which 
 registered Virginia voters may apply to serve on the Commission and selecting 
 from the applicants a list of 22 candidates. The amendment 
 requires five of the candidates to be voters who affiliate with the political party receiving the highest number of votes for Governor at the immediately 
 preceding gubernatorial election, five candidates to be voters who affiliate 
 with the political party receiving the next highest number of votes for Governor at the immediately 
 preceding gubernatorial election, and 12 candidates to be voters who do not affiliate with either of 
 those political parties. The Speaker of the House of Delegates, the minority 
 leader in the House of Delegates, and the majority and minority leaders in the 
 Senate then strike names from the list until a final list of 10 Commission members is reached consisting of three members who affiliate with the 
 political party receiving the highest number of votes for Governor at the immediately preceding 
 gubernatorial election, three members who affiliate with the political party receiving the next highest 
 number of votes for Governor at the immediately preceding gubernatorial election, and four members who do not affiliate with either 
 of those political parties. Final approval or adoption 
 of a redistricting plan requires an affirmative vote of seven of the 
 10 Commission members, including at least one vote 
 from each of the political parties represented. The amendment also contains 
 criteria to which the 
 Commission is required to 
 adhere when drawing the legislative and congressional districts, including a criterion of fairness, and imposes 
 certain requirements on the Commission's activities to ensure accessibility by 
 the public.</p>

 that when a covered person receives covered emergency services from an

 requirement. The measure deletes a provision that allows an out-of-network 
 provider to charge an individual for the balance of the provider's billed 
 amount after applying the amount the health carrier is required to pay for such 
 services. The measure also establishes a fourth standard for calculating the

 emergency services, which standard is (i) the regional average for commercial 
 payments for such service if the provider is a health care professional or (ii) 
 the fair market value for such services if the provider is a facility. This 
 fourth standard is the amount the health carrier is 
 obligated to pay to the out-of-network provider if the 
 amount is greater than any of the other three standards, which are (a) 
 the amount negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency service or, 
 if more than one amount is negotiated, the median of these amounts; (b) the 
 amount for the emergency service calculated using the same method the health 
 carrier generally uses to determine payments for out-of-network services, such 
 as the usual, customary, and reasonable amount; or (c) the amount that would be 
 paid under Medicare for the emergency service. The measure requires the health 
 carrier to pay the required amount, less applicable cost-sharing requirements, 
 directly to the out-of-network health care provider of the emergency services. 
 If such provider determines that the amount to be paid by the health carrier 
 does not comply with the applicable requirements, the measure requires the 
 provider and the health carrier to make a good faith effort to reach a 
 resolution on the appropriate amount of the reimbursement and, if a resolution 
 is not reached, authorizes either party to request 
 the State Corporation Commission to review the disputed reimbursement amount 
 and determine if the amount complies with applicable requirements. The measure 
 also provides that final diagnosis rendered to a covered person who receives 
 emergency services for a medical condition shall not be 
 considered in the health carrier's determination of whether the medical 
 condition was an emergency medical condition. The measure establishes the 
 procedure by which the regional average for commercial payments for emergency 
 services will be calculated by the nonprofit data services organization that

 a covered person receives covered emergency services from an out-of-network

 provider any amount other than the applicable cost-sharing requirement. The 
 measure deletes a provision that allows an out-of-network provider to charge an 
 individual for the balance of the provider's billed amount after applying the 
 amount the health carrier is required to pay for such services. The measure 
 also establishes a fourth standard for calculating the health carrier's 
 required payment to the out-of-network provider of the emergency services, 
 which standard is (i) the regional average for commercial payments for such 
 service if the provider is a health care professional or (ii) the fair market 
 value for such services if the provider is a facility. This fourth standard is 
 the amount the health carrier is obligated to pay 
 to the out-of-network provider if the amount is 
 greater than any of the other three standards, which are (a) the amount 
 negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency service or, if more than 
 one amount is negotiated, the median of these amounts; (b) the amount for the 
 emergency service calculated using the same method the health carrier generally 
 uses to determine payments for out-of-network services, such as the usual, 
 customary, and reasonable amount; or (c) the amount that would be paid under 
 Medicare for the emergency service. The measure requires the health carrier to 
 pay the required amount, less applicable cost-sharing requirements, directly to 
 the out-of-network health care provider of the emergency services. If such 
 provider determines that the amount to be paid by the health carrier does not 
 comply with the applicable requirements, the measure requires the provider and 
 the health carrier to make a good faith effort to reach a resolution on the 
 appropriate amount of the reimbursement and, if a resolution is not reached, 
 authorizes either party to request the State 
 Corporation Commission to review the disputed reimbursement amount and 
 determine if the amount complies with applicable requirements. The measure also

 emergency services for a medical condition shall not be

 condition was an emergency medical condition. The measure establishes the

 services will be calculated by the nonprofit data services organization that

 achieve incremental net annual savings in accordance with a schedule that 
 starts in 2021, when savings are required to be at least 0.35 percent of the 
 average annual energy retail sales by that utility in the three preceding 
 calendar years, and increases the level of required savings until 2027 and 
 thereafter, when savings are required to be at least two percent of the 
 utility's average annual energy retail sales in the three preceding calendar 
 years. The measure requires the utilities to retain an independent, qualified 
 third-party evaluator to determine the utility's incremental net annual savings 
 and other benefits of the program. The measure requires the State Corporation 
 Commission, for any year that a utility meets the annual energy efficiency 
 standard, to allow for the additional recovery of a margin on its program's 
 operating expenses through a rate adjustment clause that provides the utility 
 with a margin equal to the general rate of return on common equity. The 
 Commission is directed to award an additional 20 basis points for each 0.1 
 percent of annual savings in excess of the required amount of savings, with a 
 cap on total performance incentive awards in any year of 10 percent of the 
 utility's total energy efficiency spending in that year. The measure also (i) 
 increases the portion of the approved costs of certain utility energy 
 efficiency programs that are required to be allocated to programs designed to 
 benefit low-income, elderly, and disabled individuals from five percent to 15 
 percent of the approved costs of such programs and adds veterans to be benefited from such programs; (ii) requires the energy 
 efficiency stakeholder process established for the purpose of providing input 
 and feedback on the development of electric utilities' energy efficiency 
 programs to include the participation of certain Commission personnel who participate in approval and oversight of utility 
 efficiency programs; (iii) directs the Commission to increase the utility's 
 rates to recover for revenue reductions related to energy efficiency programs 
 if the revenue reductions have caused the utility, during the test period or 
 periods under review, to earn more than 50 basis points below a fair combined 
 rate of return on its generation and distribution services or, for any test 
 period commencing after December 31, 2012, for DEV and after December 31, 2013, 
 for AEP, more than 70 basis points below a fair combined rate of return on its 
 generation and distribution services; (iv) allows certain large general service 
 customers to avoid participation in energy efficiency programs and to avoid 
 paying for the costs of such programs through a rate adjustment clause upon 
 receiving an exemption from the Commission; and (v) provides that certain

known as  equity crowdfunding, from the registration provisions of

 Responds to the holding in <u>Paugh v. Henrico Area Mental Health and

 (2013), in which the Supreme Court of Virginia held that 
 on appeal by trial de novo in circuit court of an order of involuntary 
 commitment by a district court, upon the circuit court's finding that the 
 appellant no longer meets the criteria for involuntary commitment, the proper 
 remedy is dismissal of the Commonwealth's petition for involuntary commitment, 
 thereby rendering the original commitment order a nullity. As such, because the 
 original petition would in effect never have existed, forfeiture of the right 
 to possess a firearm as required by ยง 18.2-308.1:3 upon involuntary commitment 
 would no longer be in effect. Section 18.2-308.1:3 requires that a person who 
 has been involuntarily committed and seeks to have his firearm rights restored 
 petition a district court for restoration of his firearm rights. The ruling in <u>Paugh</u>, 
 by requiring dismissal of the original petition for commitment, removes that 
 requirement even though on the date of the original commitment hearing the 
 person did meet the criteria for commitment and was, in fact, involuntarily 
 committed. The bill provides that notwithstanding the outcome of any appeal (trial de novo on the petition for 
 commitment) taken pursuant to ยง 37.2-821, the appellant shall be required to seek restoration of his 
 firearm rights. The bill also provides that upon a finding by the 
 circuit court that the appellant no longer meets the criteria for involuntary 
 commitment or mandatory outpatient treatment, the court shall reverse the order 
 of the district court but shall not dismiss the Commonwealth's petition. As a 
 consequence of these changes, a person who is involuntarily committed would be

 Creates the Virginia Health Benefit Exchange, which will be established and

 Exchange shall facilitate the purchase and sale of qualified health plans and 
 qualified dental plans to qualified individuals and qualified employers. The 
 Exchange shall make qualified plans available to qualified individuals and 
 qualified employers by July 1, 
 2023, unless the SCC postpones this date. The 
 measure authorizes the SCC to review and approve accident and sickness 
 insurance premium rates applicable to health benefit plans in the individual 
 and small group markets and health benefit plans providing health insurance 
 coverage in the individual market through certain non-employer group plans. The 
 Exchange will be funded by assessments on health insurers. A health plan will 
 not be required to cover any state-mandated health benefit if federal law does 
 not require it to be covered as part of the essential benefits package. The 
 essential health benefits are items and services included in the benchmark 
 health insurance plan, which is the largest plan in the largest product in the 
 Commonwealth's small group market as supplemented in order to provide coverage 
 for the items and services within the statutory essential health benefits 
 categories. The SCC may contract with other eligible entities and enter into 
 memoranda of understanding with other agencies of the Commonwealth to carry out 
 any of the functions of the Exchange, including agreements with other states or 
 federal agencies to perform joint administrative functions. Such contracts are 
 not subject to the Virginia Public Procurement Act (ยง 
 2.2-4300 et seq.). The measure repeals a provision enacted in 2013 that 
 prohibits an agent, employee, officer, or agency of the Commonwealth from 
 taking any action to establish a health benefit exchange.</p>
 
 
<p class=sumtext>The measure requires the Department of Taxation to include on 
 the appropriate individual tax return forms a checkoff box or similar mechanism 
 for indicating whether the individual, or spouse in the case of a married 
 taxpayer filing jointly, (i) is an uninsured 
 individual at the time the return is filed and (ii) consents to the Department 
 of Taxation providing the individual's tax information to the Department of 
 Medical Assistance Services for purposes of determining the uninsured individual's or spouse's eligibility for medical 
 assistance. Finally, the measure requires the Secretary of Health and Human 
 Resources to convene a work 
 group that includes representatives from the SCC, 
 the Department of Medical Assistance Services, the Department of Social 
 Services, and the Department of Taxation to develop systems, policies, and 
 practices to leverage state income tax returns to facilitate the enrollment of 
 eligible individuals in insurance affordability programs through the Virginia 
 Health Benefit Exchange established in this measure.

 required to produce their electricity from 100 percent renewable sources by 
 2050, with annual steps that direct the electricity be generated in specific 
 percentages in nine tiers or sub-tiers. A utility or supplier that does not 
 meet its targets is required to pay a specific deficiency payment or purchase 
 renewable energy certificates. The proceeds from the deficiency payments are to 
 be deposited into an account administered by the Department of Mines, Minerals 
 and Energy, which is directed to distribute specific percentages of the moneys 
 to low-income, disability, veteran, and age-qualifying energy efficiency 
 programs; additional energy efficiency measures for public facilities; coastal 
 resiliency efforts; and administrative costs. Among other things, the measure 
 also (i) adopts a 2,400 megawatt energy storage deployment target for the 
 Commonwealth and requires the State Corporation Commission 
 (the Commission) to adopt regulations for the implementation of the 
 energy storage deployment target that outline a deployment target of 2,400 
 megawatts by 2035 with interim targets that include Commission-approved energy 
 storage system resources; (ii) establishes an energy efficiency standard under 
 which each investor-owned incumbent electric utility is required to achieve 
 incremental annual energy efficiency savings that start in 2021 at 0.35 percent 
 of the average annual energy retail sales by that utility in the three 
 preceding calendar years and increase annually until 2027 and thereafter when 
 energy efficiency savings of at least two percent of the average annual energy 
 retail sales by that utility in the three preceding calendar years are 
 required; (iii) exempts large general service customers from energy savings 
 requirements; (iv) revises the incentive for electric utility energy efficiency 
 programs; (v) provides that if the Commission finds in any triennial review 
 that revenue reductions related to energy efficiency measures or programs 
 approved and deployed since the utility's previous triennial review have caused 
 the utility to earn more than 50 basis points below a fair combined rate of

 wind, the utility shall identify options for utilizing local workers, consult 
 with the Commonwealth's Chief Workforce Development Officer on opportunities to 
 advance the Commonwealth's workforce goals, including furtherance of 
 apprenticeship and other workforce training programs to develop the local 
 workforce, and give priority to the hiring of local workers; (vii) requires 
 each utility to include, and the Commission to consider, in any application to 
 construct a new generating facility the social cost of carbon as a cost adder; 
 (viii) removes provisions that authorize nuclear and offshore wind generating 
 facilities to continue to be eligible for an enhanced rate of return on common 
 equity during the construction phase of the facility and the approved first 
 portion of its service life of between 12 and 25 years in the case of a

 generation facilities that are declared to be in the public interest; (xi) 
 amends the net energy metering program by increasing the maximum capacity of 
 renewable generation facilities of participating nonresidential eligible 
 customer-generators from one to three megawatts, increases the cap on the 
 capacity of generation from facilities from the customer's expected annual 
 energy consumption to 150 percent of such amount, increases
